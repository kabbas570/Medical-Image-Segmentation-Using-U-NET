# Medical-Image-Segmentation-Using-U-NET


This project explains about Medical Image Segmentation Using U-NET. It has following parts

1- How to read data (input and target mask)?
2- Make U-Net Model using Keras framework.
3- Test the network

In main.py file I call the data_read funstion which willread the dataset.
Then call Model function which will make a U-Net model and thenw e trian it
Finally in test.py we test the model on un-seen datset.
